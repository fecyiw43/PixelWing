A flappy bird like game that uses flame engine (flutter based game engine) as its main developement framework, the game itself is linked with a database (firebase) that updates the leaderboard in real time if the player is playing the game while signed-in. Additional features such as a pause button is also implemented to enhance the gaming experience.

To run the game (using VScode)
- git clone the project into your local directory
- Run the project inside VScode by clicking on 'run', then 'run without debugging' (note, this game currently only runs in mobile devices or mobile emulators)
